This is Laravel Project based on https://github.com/mr-devD/PHPProject.

The goal of project is same, just with using laravel.<br>
I haven't really focused on making everything look pretty like i did on original one, but still everything is functional and okay looking.<br>

It has, LOGIN, REGISTER, CHANGE PASSWORD pages, which are laravel default, not edited<br>
